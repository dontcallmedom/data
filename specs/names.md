This file is used to map the short name of a specification to its formal name and URL.

REMINDERS:

* Whenever possible, specify a link to the Editor Draft of a spec. This is the most up-to-date draft. This is not always possible: sometimes the editor version describe a further level than the published spec: in this case list both, with the Editor Draft on top. This is the case for CSP 1.0 where the ED draft described a further level of CSP and is far from the Recommendation status.
* If both W3C and WHATWG publish specifications for an API, we list any distinct specifications (e.g. W3C DOM 1/2/3 are distinct from the WHATWG DOM Living Standard). We do not list W3C specifications that are [outdated forks of WHATWG specifications](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Fork_tracking), except for certain historical exceptions.
* Please use HTTPS links instead of HTTP links when possible.
